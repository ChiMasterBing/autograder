                    Do NOT submit malicious code with malicious intent to the grader. Furthermore, do not attempt to exploit any
                    aspect of this system, including but not limited to, accessing unauthorized admin privileges, accessing private
                    user information, etc. If we find out any misuse, you will be disqualified from participating in TJCT
                    competitions, events, and also reported to our sponsors.<br><br>
                    Furthermore, please follow all rules given when taking contests on this system. Perhaps there will be
                    collaborative contests, but unless otherwise stated, contests are individual. All aspects of the TJHSST honor
                    code apply.

                    In general, please note what you can and cannot do for contests. These are subject to change.
                    <br>
                    1. You ARE allowed to use templates and pre-written datastructures. We acknowledge that in-houses are short on
                    time and having pre-written code can make the process much less tedious.
                    <br>
                    2. You ARE allowed to use reference sources online such as language specific documentation. General algorithm guides
                    such as GeeksForGeeks is allowed if the guide doesn't completely solve the problem.
                    <br>
                    3. You are NOT allowed consult intelligent/human sources during a contest.
                    <br>
                    4. You are NOT allowed to discuss problem details until the allotted time window for the contest is over.
                    <br><br>
