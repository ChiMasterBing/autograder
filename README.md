This repository contains most of the website that deals with how pages are rendered to users. The part of the website that runs code and judges it can be found at this repository: https://github.com/scienceqiu/coderunner.

### Getting Started

Public folder: Homepage Animation, mainly visual

Routes folder: Main grader code
- admin.js = admin functions
- grade.js = main functions
- runTests.js = portal to VM2 (where the code gets run)
- sql.js = functions to interact with database
